This template from CHI expects that some extra LaTeX packages to be present,
including but not limited to:

	* titlesec 
	* ragged2e
	* ccicons

If this doesn't come with your installation of LaTeX these may be found on CTAN:
	* http://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec
	* http://ctan.org/pkg/ragged2e
	* http://ctan.org/pkg/ccicons

Under Gentoo Linux emerge these ebulids to successfully render the document:

	* dev-texlive/texlive-latexextra
	* dev-texlive/texlive-fontsextra
